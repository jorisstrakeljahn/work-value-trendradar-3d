## 📝 Development

### Project Structure

The project follows a **domain-driven architecture**:

```
src/
├── domains/              # Feature-based domains
│   ├── admin/           # Admin functionality (CRUD operations)
│   ├── auth/            # Authentication
│   ├── radar/           # 3D radar visualization
│   ├── explanation/      # Explanation section
│   └── layout/          # Layout components (Header, etc.)
├── shared/              # Shared utilities & components
│   ├── components/     # Reusable UI components
│   ├── hooks/          # Shared React hooks
│   ├── utils/          # Utility functions
│   └── constants/      # App-wide constants
├── firebase/            # Firebase services
│   └── services/       # Organized by entity (signals, industries)
├── store/              # Zustand state management
└── types/              # TypeScript type definitions
```

### Key Design Decisions

- **Domain-Driven Design**: Code organized by business domains for better maintainability
- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript with type guards and strict mode
- **Performance**: React.memo, useMemo, useCallback, and code splitting
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error logging with context-aware messages
- **Code Organization**: Services split into converters, queries, mutations, subscriptions

### Development Scripts

```bash
# Development
npm run dev              # Start dev server

# Code Quality
npm run lint            # Run ESLint
npm run format          # Format code with Prettier
npm run format:check    # Check formatting

# Build
npm run build           # Production build
npm run preview         # Preview production build
```

## 🔥 Firebase Setup

### Firestore Security Rules

The Firestore Security Rules must be configured in the Firebase Console. The `firestore.rules` file contains the necessary rules.

**How to set up the Rules:**

1. Open the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Select your project
3. Go to **Firestore Database** > **Rules**
4. Copy the content from the `firestore.rules` file
5. Paste the rules into the console
6. Click **Publish**

**The rules allow:**
- **Read**: Anyone can read signals (public viewing)
- **Create**: Only authenticated users can create signals
- **Update/Delete**: Only the creator of a signal can edit/delete it

### Firebase Storage Rules

If you want to upload images, Storage Rules must also be configured. The `storage.rules` file contains the necessary rules.

**How to set up the Rules:**

1. Open the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Select your project
3. Go to **Storage** > **Rules**
4. Copy the content from the `storage.rules` file
5. Paste the rules into the console
6. Click **Publish**

**The rules allow:**
- **Write**: Only authenticated users can upload images
- **Read**: Anyone can view images (public access)

## 🚢 Deployment

The project can be deployed on any static hosting service:

### Vercel / Netlify

1. Push repository to GitHub/GitLab
2. Import project in Vercel/Netlify
3. Configure environment variables in dashboard
4. Build command: `npm run build`
5. Output directory: `dist`

### Environment Variables

Make sure to set all Firebase environment variables in your hosting platform:
- `VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY`
- `VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN`
- `VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID`
- `VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET`
- `VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID`
- `VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID`
- `VITE_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID`

## 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

### Performance Optimizations
- **Code Splitting**: Lazy loading for RadarSection and ExplanationSection
- **Memoization**: React.memo for expensive components, useMemo for calculations
- **Bundle Optimization**: Manual chunks for vendor libraries (Three.js, Firebase, etc.)
- **Image Preloading**: Images preloaded on hover for instant display

### Error Handling
- Centralized error logging with context
- User-friendly error messages with i18n support
- Error boundaries for graceful error recovery
- Type guards for runtime type safety

### State Management
- Zustand for lightweight state management
- Domain-specific stores (auth, radar, modals, windows, theme)
- Optimized re-renders with selective subscriptions
