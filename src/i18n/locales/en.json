    "title": "Understanding the 3D Trend Radar",
    "intro": "This interactive 3D visualization maps weak signals of AI and robotics technologies and their potential impact on the value of work across different industries. Each point represents a trend or signal, positioned in three-dimensional space based on its characteristics.",
    "threeDimensions": "The Three Dimensions",
    "xAxisTitle": "X-Axis: Impact / Relevance",
    "xAxisDesc": "Measures how significant the impact of this trend is on the industry. Points further to the right indicate higher impact and relevance. This dimension helps identify which signals are most likely to transform work practices.",
    "yAxisTitle": "Y-Axis: Time Horizon / Maturity",
    "yAxisDesc": "Represents the temporal dimension of the trend. The center of the radar represents trends happening now, while the outer levels represent future developments. This radial mapping follows the classic trend radar pattern, making it intuitive to understand when trends might materialize.",
    "yAxisNow": "Center (Now): Current trends and technologies",
    "yAxisNext": "Middle Level (Next): Near-term developments (1-3 years)",
    "yAxisFar": "Outer Level (Far): Long-term future trends (3+ years)",
    "zAxisTitle": "Z-Axis: Work-Value-Index",
    "zAxisDesc": "The height of each point indicates how the trend affects the value of work. Higher points represent trends that increase work value, while lower points indicate trends with less positive impact or potential devaluation. This index is calculated from four sub-dimensions:",
    "zAxisEconomic": "Economic: Financial value and compensation",
    "zAxisSocial": "Social: Social recognition and status",
    "zAxisSubjective": "Subjective: Personal fulfillment and meaning",
    "zAxisPolitical": "Political: Influence and decision-making power",
    "workValueCalculation": "Work-Value-Index Calculation",
    "workValueCalcDesc1": "The Work-Value-Index is calculated from four sub-dimensions, each rated on a scale from 0 to 5. Each dimension measures a different aspect of work value:",
    "workValueCalcEconomic": "Economic (30% weight):",
    "workValueCalcEconomicDesc": "Measures the financial value and compensation associated with the work. Higher values indicate rising wages or new income sources, lower values indicate reduced compensation.",
    "workValueCalcSocial": "Social (25% weight):",
    "workValueCalcSocialDesc": "Evaluates the social recognition and status that comes with the work. Higher values mean increased prestige or societal appreciation, lower values indicate reduced recognition.",
    "workValueCalcSubjective": "Subjective (25% weight):",
    "workValueCalcSubjectiveDesc": "Captures the personal fulfillment and meaning people find in their work. Higher values indicate increased satisfaction or meaningfulness, lower values indicate reduced fulfillment.",
    "workValueCalcPolitical": "Political (20% weight):",
    "workValueCalcPoliticalDesc": "Measures the influence and decision-making power associated with the work. Higher values indicate more autonomy or influence, lower values indicate reduced control or power.",
    "workValueCalcDesc2": "These four values are normalized (from 0..5 to 0..100) and then multiplied by their respective weights. The result is a Work-Value-Index between 0 and 100, where 0 means all dimensions are at 0 (no value change) and 100 is the maximum (all dimensions at 5). In the 3D radar, this index is then directly mapped to height (Z-axis), where 0 lies on the X-axis plane and 100 reaches maximum height.",

    "ratingScalePolitical": "Political",
    "ratingScale0Economic": "Strong devaluation: massive wage/price pressure, strong substitution, significant deskilling, collapsing income security; skills clearly lose market value.",
    "ratingScale1Economic": "Significant devaluation: noticeable wage/price pressure, relevant substitution effects, declining bargaining power; more precarity/uncertainty.",
    "ratingScale2Economic": "Slight devaluation: slight wage-price pressure, selective substitution, initial deskilling tendencies; reduced income stability for subgroups.",
    "ratingScale3Economic": "Neutral / ambivalent: overall no clear direction or strong polarization (e.g., high-wage appreciation and low-wage devaluation).",
    "ratingScale4Economic": "Appreciation: noticeably better compensation or more stable income; new roles/income sources; higher demand for skills; employees receive share of productivity gains.",
    "ratingScale5Economic": "Strong appreciation: significant income increases, high security/predictability; multiple new income sources; skills gain strongly in market value and bargaining power.",
    "ratingScale0Social": "Strong devaluation: significant status loss/stigmatization; expertise is devalued or becomes \"invisible\"; recognition drops sharply in the relevant reference group.",
    "ratingScale1Social": "Significant devaluation: noticeable loss of prestige and recognition; activity is clearly framed as replaceable; recognition visibly declines.",
    "ratingScale2Social": "Slight devaluation: slight decline in recognition/prestige; expertise becomes less visible; status declines moderately or only in parts.",
    "ratingScale3Social": "Neutral / ambivalent: recognition/status depends on industry/public/organization; mixed signals.",
    "ratingScale4Social": "Appreciation: clearly more prestige/professionalization; expertise becomes more visible; recognition increases (e.g., new standards/certifications).",
    "ratingScale5Social": "Strong appreciation: very high prestige gain and societal appreciation; strong institutional appreciation; recognition increases significantly in the relevant reference group.",
    "ratingScale0Subjective": "Strong devaluation: strong control/pacing, high workload, significant loss of autonomy; strong alienation/monotony, competence fit drops massively.",
    "ratingScale1Subjective": "Significant devaluation: significantly less autonomy, noticeably more stress/monitoring; tasks become more fragmented; meaning/experience deteriorates.",
    "ratingScale2Subjective": "Slight devaluation: somewhat less autonomy, slightly increased workload; more routine/fragmentation; learning/meaning components decrease somewhat.",
    "ratingScale3Subjective": "Neutral / ambivalent: effects strongly role-dependent (e.g., experts gain autonomy, operational roles lose).",
    "ratingScale4Subjective": "Appreciation: monotonous work decreases, learning and development opportunities increase; more autonomy/scope for action; workload noticeably decreases; meaning connections strengthen.",
    "ratingScale5Subjective": "Strong appreciation: significantly better work quality: much more autonomy, strong reduction of stress/monotony; greatly expanded learning paths; high meaningfulness/fit.",
    "ratingScale0Political": "Strong devaluation: strong power asymmetry/monitoring, codetermination practically undermined; non-transparent control logics; dependence on platform/provider increases strongly.",
    "ratingScale1Political": "Significant devaluation: decision-making spaces actually shrink; algorithmic control increases; responsibility is shifted downward; transparency decreases.",
    "ratingScale2Political": "Slight devaluation: slightly less influence/codetermination; somewhat more monitoring or less traceability; governance becomes somewhat more asymmetric.",
    "ratingScale3Political": "Neutral / ambivalent: depends on regulation, collective agreements, organizational form and governance maturity; mixed effects.",
    "ratingScale4Political": "Appreciation: more participation/influence, stronger protection rights; more transparent governance (e.g., clear responsibilities, auditability); better negotiation positions.",
    "ratingScale5Political": "Strong appreciation: very high decision-making power/participation; strong institutional protection; high transparency/auditability of control logics; governance clearly fair and traceable.",
