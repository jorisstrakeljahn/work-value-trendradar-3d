    "title": "Understanding the 3D Trend Radar",
    "intro": "This interactive 3D visualization maps weak signals of AI and robotics technologies and their potential impact on the value of work across different industries. Each point represents a trend or signal, positioned in three-dimensional space based on its characteristics.",
    "threeDimensions": "The Three Dimensions",
    "xAxisTitle": "X-Axis: Impact / Relevance",
    "xAxisDesc": "Measures how significant the impact of this trend is on the industry. Points further to the right indicate higher impact and relevance. This dimension helps identify which signals are most likely to transform work practices.",
    "yAxisTitle": "Y-Axis: Time Horizon / Maturity",
    "yAxisDesc": "Represents the temporal dimension of the trend. The center of the radar represents trends happening now, while the outer rings represent future developments. This radial mapping follows the classic trend radar pattern, making it intuitive to understand when trends might materialize.",
    "yAxisNow": "Center (Now): Current trends and technologies",
    "yAxisNext": "Middle Ring (Next): Near-term developments (1-3 years)",
    "yAxisFar": "Outer Ring (Far): Long-term future trends (3+ years)",
    "zAxisTitle": "Z-Axis: Work-Value-Index",
    "zAxisDesc": "The height of each point indicates how the trend affects the value of work. Higher points represent trends that increase work value, while lower points indicate trends with less positive impact or potential devaluation. This index is calculated from four sub-dimensions:",
    "zAxisEconomic": "Economic: Financial value and compensation",
    "zAxisSocial": "Social: Social recognition and status",
    "zAxisSubjective": "Subjective: Personal fulfillment and meaning",
    "zAxisPolitical": "Political: Influence and decision-making power",
    "workValueCalculation": "Work-Value-Index Calculation",
    "workValueCalcDesc1": "The Work-Value-Index is calculated from four sub-dimensions, each rated on a scale from 0 to 5. Each dimension measures a different aspect of work value:",
    "workValueCalcEconomic": "Economic (30% weight):",
    "workValueCalcEconomicDesc": "Measures the financial value and compensation associated with the work. Higher values indicate rising wages or new income sources, lower values indicate reduced compensation.",
    "workValueCalcSocial": "Social (25% weight):",
    "workValueCalcSocialDesc": "Evaluates the social recognition and status that comes with the work. Higher values mean increased prestige or societal appreciation, lower values indicate reduced recognition.",
    "workValueCalcSubjective": "Subjective (25% weight):",
    "workValueCalcSubjectiveDesc": "Captures the personal fulfillment and meaning people find in their work. Higher values indicate increased satisfaction or meaningfulness, lower values indicate reduced fulfillment.",
    "workValueCalcPolitical": "Political (20% weight):",
    "workValueCalcPoliticalDesc": "Measures the influence and decision-making power associated with the work. Higher values indicate more autonomy or influence, lower values indicate reduced control or power.",
    "workValueCalcDesc2": "These four values are normalized (from 0..5 to 0..100) and then multiplied by their respective weights. The result is a Work-Value-Index between 0 and 100, where 0 means all dimensions are at 0 (no value change) and 100 is the maximum (all dimensions at 5). In the 3D radar, this index is then directly mapped to height (Z-axis), where 0 lies on the X-axis plane and 100 reaches maximum height.",
    "ratingScale": "Rating Scale",
    "ratingScaleTitle": "Detailed Rating Scale (0-5)",
    "ratingScaleIntro": "The following table explains how each rating level (0-5) is interpreted for the four value dimensions:",
    "ratingScaleValue": "Value",
    "ratingScaleEconomic": "Economic",
    "ratingScaleSocial": "Social",
    "ratingScaleSubjective": "Subjective",
    "ratingScalePolitical": "Political",
    "ratingScale0Economic": "No change in the financial value of work. Compensation, income security, and economic value of skills remain unchanged.",
    "ratingScale0Social": "No change in recognition, status, and societal appreciation of work. Activities remain symbolically framed and evaluated the same way.",
    "ratingScale0Subjective": "No change in meaning, experience, and psychological quality of work. Autonomy experience, workload, competence fit, learning opportunities, meaningfulness, and emotional quality remain unchanged.",
    "ratingScale0Political": "No change in influence, decision-making power, and institutional protection mechanisms. Workplace codetermination, autonomy in decision-making processes, and transparency of control logics remain unchanged.",
    "ratingScale1Economic": "Slight devaluation: Signal favors slight wage or price pressure, minimal substitution effects, or minor reduction in bargaining power in compensation.",
    "ratingScale1Social": "Slight devaluation: Signal leads to minimal reduction in prestige, slight devaluation of visible expertise, or minor reduction in recognition.",
    "ratingScale1Subjective": "Slight devaluation: Signal leads to minimal reduction in autonomy, slight increase in workload, or minor fragmentation of activities.",
    "ratingScale1Political": "Slight devaluation: Signal leads to minimal reduction in influence, slight restriction of codetermination spaces, or minor reduction in transparency of control logics.",
    "ratingScale2Economic": "Significant devaluation: Signal leads to wage or price pressure, substitution effects, dequalification, declining bargaining power in compensation, or shift to precarious arrangements.",
    "ratingScale2Social": "Significant devaluation: Work loses status, is framed as replaceable, becomes \"invisible\" (e.g., shift to back-office/control functions without recognition), or stigmatization and devaluation narratives emerge.",
    "ratingScale2Subjective": "Significant devaluation: Work becomes more monitored, stress and pacing increase, activities become fragmented, competence devaluation is experienced, or alienation effects occur (e.g., pure \"control\" or \"error correction roles\" without creative component).",
    "ratingScale2Political": "Significant devaluation: Control becomes more asymmetric, monitoring and algorithmic control increase, responsibilities are shifted, codetermination spaces are effectively restricted, or dependencies on platforms/providers emerge that reduce employee power.",
    "ratingScale3Economic": "Ambivalent change: Simultaneously occurring revaluation and devaluation effects (e.g., polarization into high- and low-wage sectors). Without context differentiation, this middle rating is preferable.",
    "ratingScale3Social": "Ambivalent change: Mixed signals regarding status and recognition. Since status varies strongly culturally and industry-specifically, the rating should be marked as uncertain if the social reference group (organization, industry, public) cannot be explicitly identified.",
    "ratingScale3Subjective": "Ambivalent change: Mixed effects on fulfillment. Subjective effects are often heterogeneous; the effect may primarily apply to certain role profiles (e.g., experts vs. operational roles). Without this differentiation, restraint in scaling is advised.",
    "ratingScale3Political": "Ambivalent change: Mixed effects on influence and decision-making power. Political effects often occur mediated through regulation, collective bargaining, and organizational form; therefore, context description is particularly relevant. Without clear context, this middle rating is preferable.",
    "ratingScale4Economic": "Significant revaluation: Signal associated with rising compensation, higher productivity rent for employees, new income sources (e.g., new role profiles), higher labor market demand, or improved income stability.",
    "ratingScale4Social": "Significant revaluation: Signal associated with higher prestige, visible expertise, increased recognition, or institutional revaluation (e.g., certifications, professionalization).",
    "ratingScale4Subjective": "Significant revaluation: Signal reduces monotonous activities, expands learning and development opportunities, increases autonomy or scope for action, reduces workload, or strengthens meaning connections.",
    "ratingScale4Political": "Significant revaluation: Signal leads to more influence on work processes, higher participation, stronger protection rights, traceable governance (e.g., auditability of AI systems, clear responsibilities), or improved negotiation positions.",
    "ratingScale5Economic": "Strong revaluation: Signal leads to substantial increases in compensation, multiple new income sources, strongly increased productivity rent, or significantly improved income security and value of skills.",
    "ratingScale5Social": "Strong revaluation: Signal leads to substantial prestige gain, high societal appreciation, strong institutional revaluation, or significantly increased recognition in the relevant social reference group.",
    "ratingScale5Subjective": "Strong revaluation: Signal leads to substantial reduction in monotony, strongly expanded learning and development opportunities, significantly increased autonomy, significantly reduced workload, or strongly strengthened meaning connections and high meaningfulness.",
    "ratingScale5Political": "Strong revaluation: Signal leads to substantial influence on work processes, strong participation, very strong protection rights, high transparency and auditability of control logics, or significantly improved negotiation positions and decision-making power.",
